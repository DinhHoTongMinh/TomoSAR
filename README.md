The TomoSAR was designed as an end-to-end software platform for processing 
multi-sensor SAR images. The kernel of this platform supports the entire 
processing from SAR, Interferometry, Polarimetry, to Tomography (so-called TomoSAR). 

The platform is based on the previous works done by D. Ho Tong Minh in the
frame of his research at the Politecnico di Milano, CESBIO and continuously
developed by his group at INRAE.

We made it open-source on a part of TomoSAR for PSDS and ComSAR algorithms. 
More detail information on the algorithms are available here:

Finally, we created an interactive social forum (https://www.facebook.com/groups/RadarInterferometry) 
where researchers can consult other colleagues, share information, help each other, 
and develop topics about not only our open-source TomoSAR but also everything in the InSAR field.
